## The Crystal Workflow

1. Create sessions from prompts, each in an isolated git worktree
2. Iterate with Claude Code inside your sessions. Each iteration will make a commit so you can always go back.
3. Review the diff changes and make manual edits as needed
4. Squash your commits together with a new message and rebase to your main branch.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🚀 Parallel Sessions** - Run multiple Claude Code instances at once
- **🌳 Git Worktree Isolation** - Each session gets its own branch
- **💾 Session Persistence** - Resume conversations anytime
- **🔧 Git Integration** - Built-in rebase and squash operations
- **📊 Change Tracking** - View diffs and track modifications
- **🔔 Notifications** - Desktop alerts when sessions need input
- **🏗️ Run Scripts** - Test changes instantly without leaving Crystal
- **🌐 Web Server Mode** - Access Crystal remotely via web browser
- **🔒 Secure Remote Access** - API key authentication and CORS configuration
- **📱 Cross-Platform Access** - Use Crystal from any device with a web browser
- **🔌 RESTful API** - Complete API access to all Crystal functionality

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code installed and logged in or API key provided
- Git installed
- Git repository (Crystal will initialize one if needed)

### 1. Create a Project
Create a new project if you haven't already. This can be an empty folder or an existing git repository. Crystal will initialize git if needed.

### 2. Create Sessions from a Prompt
For any feature you're working on, create one or multiple new sessions:
- Each session will be an isolated git worktree

### 3. Monitor and Test Your Changes
As sessions complete:
- **Configure run scripts** in project settings to test your application without leaving Crystal
- **Use the diff viewer** to review all changes and make manual edits as needed
- **Continue conversations** with Claude Code if you need additional changes

### 4. Finalize Your Changes
When everything looks good:
- Click **"Rebase to main"** to squash all commits with a new message and rebase them to your main branch
- This creates a clean commit history on your main branch

### Git Operations
- **Rebase from main**: Pull latest changes from main into your worktree
- **Squash and rebase to main**: Combine all commits and rebase onto main
- Always preview commands with tooltips before executing

## 🌐 Web Server Mode

Crystal can run as a web server, allowing you to access it remotely from any device with a web browser while maintaining all desktop functionality.

### Quick Setup

1. **Enable Web Server** - Add to your Crystal config (`~/.crystal/config.json`):
```json
{
  "webServer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "port": 3001,
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "auth": {
      "enabled": true,
      "apiKey": "generate-with-openssl-rand-hex-32"
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Start Crystal** - Run Crystal normally, the web server starts automatically
3. **Access Remotely** - Open `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3001` in any web browser

### Web Server Features

- **🖥️ Full Desktop UI** - Complete Crystal interface in your browser
- **🔌 RESTful API** - Programmatic access to all Crystal functionality
- **🔐 Secure Authentication** - Optional API key protection
- **🌍 CORS Support** - Configurable cross-origin resource sharing
- **📱 Mobile Friendly** - Works on tablets and mobile devices

### API Examples

```bash
# Set your API key first
export CRYSTAL_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key"

# Get all sessions
curl -H "X-API-Key: $CRYSTAL_API_KEY" http://localhost:3001/api/sessions

# Create a new session
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-API-Key: $CRYSTAL_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"name": "My Session", "prompt": "Help me build a web app"}' \
  http://localhost:3001/api/sessions

# Continue a conversation
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-API-Key: $CRYSTAL_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"message": "Add error handling"}' \
  http://localhost:3001/api/sessions/session-id/continue
```

### Developing Crystal with Crystal

If you're using Crystal to develop Crystal itself, you need to use a separate data directory to avoid conflicts with your main Crystal instance:

```bash
# Set the run script in your Crystal project settings to:
pnpm run setup && CRYSTAL_DIR=~/.crystal_test pnpm electron-dev
```

This ensures:
- Your development Crystal instance uses `~/.crystal_test` for its data
- Your main Crystal instance continues using `~/.crystal` 
- Worktrees won't conflict between the two instances
- You can safely test changes without affecting your primary Crystal setup
